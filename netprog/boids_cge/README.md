## Project

**Name:** boids_cge

**Description:** 
Boids version 0.1.1

Console-Game-Engine Boids starter implementation without physics.

This project is tribute to the many great Boids projects that already exist in this day and age
of excellent developers! We live in a time when the technology is pushing the limits of discovery, and one 
of the many great advantages a beginner has is that there is a plethora of excellent material to draw from 
in any genre you can think of! If you are willing to look for it, there is more quality material freely
available that there has ever been. This calls into question the value of traditional education. Sadly
it is harder to afford and the investment is no longer a 'sure-thing' in terms of what you hope to return
for years of study and a lot of tuition. My aim is to sound a trumpet as a call to all those who have a genuine 
thirst for knowlege and learning! To spread awareness of a new idea of how we obtain our knowledge and education!
I am learning to be a Self-Taught individual. And a large portion of the education and skills I have learned
have indeed been Self-Learned ones. Anyone can do the same with a little effort and a thirst for knowledge.

    Here is a good place to start! We will utilize the olcConsoleGameEngine by Javidx9, and create a simplified version
of the Boids project. We will start with a 2D screen saver version and build it up over time, adding new features
one by one. Happy Thanksgiving and happy coding!
