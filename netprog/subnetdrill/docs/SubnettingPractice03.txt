Okay! I did surprising well on the first three, but I was only able to 'quickly' 
calculate #3. 
I had a hiccup on number 1, I made the same mistake as earlier, I picked the wrong
block range. When I went to check against the app I felt a rush of
anxiety. But I realized my mistake, it was the same mess up I made
from earlier...
Anyway, I went back and figured it out. Then by number three 
I started to feel a little better about this. I think if I can 
recall the chart on exam day I will have no problem getting the right
figures. However, I think I need to do these drills EVERY SINGLE DAY
until the exam LOL! Because I am far too slow right now.

Anyway, I got home late and it took me about 40 minutes to get these right. 
I think I am done for the evening. In the morning I think I will plan on 
doing the rest of these for my morning subnet drills. What do you think?
Oh by the way I should mention, part of doing this was recalling the chart
from memory and i think I have it down. I had a talk with my family and politely
reminded them about my upcoming exams. They agreed they could manage without 
as much of my help just for the next few weeks and encouraged me to "lock myself in my room lol,(jokingly of course) so I can focus a little more more
on making sure I am getting my 'study' quota.
