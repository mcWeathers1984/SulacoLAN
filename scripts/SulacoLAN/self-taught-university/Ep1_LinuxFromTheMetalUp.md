Begin>  We start with an introduction from Red

Linux is not just for servers or for furries. Linux is freedom. Linux is power.
Linux gives you choices.

No more bowing down to big-cousin Bill
Or big uncle's pricetag

Linux is real
And we are going to start here, from the Metal Up...

My Name is Mike. 

I grew up in the Southwest.
One day I woke up in the grips of addiction, I was in a miserable place and suffering. I was ready to die.

Lets fast forward 5 years. I managed to crawl out of a hole. A hole filled with alcoholism, needles and hard drugs.
Now I am getting my life back together. It's not going to be easy, but nothing
worth doing ever is. 

I'm not where I want to be yet, but I am on my way.

I love programming. I love technology and music.
Last year (2025) I decided to work on my skills, I passed my A+ exam and last month(November) I passed the Linux+

I want the Network+, the Security+ for starters.
And I want to up my programming game. C and C++, Rust are my main interests. Mostly system and a little bit of Web Development.

I passed the Linux+, but barely. The test made me realize something for the real world; you have to be good.
Just passing the test doesn't make you good. It's a starting point.

You have to be able to learn new things. And keep learning new things.
if you can't or don't want to, this is not for you. You will always be learning something new.
And once you learn how to teach yourself, you learn how to learn on your own.
It's hard at first. But it get's easier. And more enjoyable.

I like to keep busy. I have bad thoughts and even worse habits when my hands get idle.
So my strategy that works for me is to keep myself busy learning.
And I am happier than I have ever been.

Join me on my journey, and start your own journey.
