Self-Taught-University:
* Home Lab Series
   Setting up a home lab for learning networking and security, as well as systems and network
   programming.
   We will be using this home lab specifically for preparing for the CompTIA Network+ and
   the CompTIA Security+ certification exams. I am in the process of creating these
   two series for this channel. 

   We will be building a lab for learning Linux System Administration and Networking.
   For the Linux series we will be focusing on, well, Linux; so we will have 4 PC's
   which will all have some Linux distro or Windows-Subsystem for Linux.

   In order to get as much Linux exposure, we will use distributions with the APT and
   the DNF package managers. So we will use Debian and Fedora.

   Here are the machines I will be using:

   *HP Slim Desktop PC -Debian with XFCE
   *Raspberry Pi 5(8GB)-Raspian
   *HP Slim Desktop PC -Fedora CLI
   *HP Victus-WSL-Debian-

   Network+_ Objectives
    Raspberry Pi - Router
                 -DNS
                 -SSH
                 -NAT
                 -DHCP
                 
   For each we will keep all the machines lean and clean
   So we can easily do reinstallations if neeeded
